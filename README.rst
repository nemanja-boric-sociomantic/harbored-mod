**NOTE**: the default output format has been changed to one file per aggregate instead of
one file per symbol. Use `--format=html-simple` to get the previous default output format.

------------
Introduction
------------

Documentation generator for `D <http://dlang.org>`_ with Markdown support, based on
`harbored <https://github.com/economicmodeling/harbored>`_.

Harbored-mod supports both `DDoc <http://dlang.org/ddoc.html>`_ and `Markdown
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>`_ in documentation comments, but DDoc takes
precedence. This means that there are slight differences_ from standard Markdown.

-----------------------------------
Examples of generated documentation
-----------------------------------

* `Public imports in a package.d <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis-core/api/tharsis/entity.html>`_
* `Class with a template parameter, member functions and aliases <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis-core/api/tharsis/entity/entitymanager/EntityManager.html>`_
* `Simple DDoc See_Also: section <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis-core/api/tharsis/entity/componenttypeinfo/ImmutableRawComponent.html>`_
* `Note: DDoc section with some markdown <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis-core/api/tharsis/entity/processtypeinfo.html#prioritizeProcessOverloads>`_ (**bold**, \`code\`, *italic*)

---------------
Getting started
---------------

.. note:: There are experimental binaries for some platforms on the
          `releases <https://github.com/kiith-sa/harbored-mod/releases>`_ page.
          If you're using a binary, you can jump to **Setting up**.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Building with DUB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have `DUB <http://code.dlang.org>`_ installed:
  
* get harbored-mod::

     git clone https://github.com/kiith-sa/harbored-mod.git

* Go into the directory harbored-mod was cloned into::

     cd harbored-mod

* Compile::

     dub build

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Building with Make
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This assumes you are using the DMD compiler. Currently, harbored-mod uses a Makefile
hardcoded to DMD. Eventually it will be moved to `dub <http://code.dlang.org>`_.

* get harbored-mod and its dependencies::

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/kiith-sa/harbored-mod.git

* Go into the directory harbored-mod was cloned into::

     cd harbored-mod

* Compile::

     make

^^^^^^^^^^
Setting up
^^^^^^^^^^

At this point you should have a binary called ``hmod`` in the ``bin`` directory.

* Modify your ``PATH`` to point to the ``bin`` directory or copy the binary into your project.

* From your project's directory, run ``hmod``. This assumes your source code is in the
  ``./source`` subdirectory (as is often the case with ``dub`` projects) and that the
  ``hmod`` binary is in ``PATH``, prepend with ``./`` if it's in the project directory).::

     hmod source

  This will write generate documentation to the ``./doc`` subdirectory. See
  ``./doc/index.html``. Note that the main page will be blank, although you should see
  a list of all modules on the left.


  To further tweak the documentation, generate the default configuration file::

     hmod -g

  This will generate a file called ``hmod.cfg`` in the current directory. Harbored-mod
  looks for this file in the directory it's running from, and if present, loads
  configuration options such as main page content, style, files to exclude from
  documentation generation, and so on. See comments in ``hmod.cfg`` for more information.



--------
Features
--------

* Supports DDoc **and** (most, see differences_) Markdown syntax
* Sensible defaults (get decent documentation without tweaking any settings)
* Automatic cross-referencing in code blocks and ``inline code``
* Very fast; it takes ``0.11s`` to generate API documentation
  `documentation <http://defenestrate.eu/docs/tharsis-core/api/index.html>`_ of
  `tharsis-core <https://github.com/kiith-sa/tharsis-core>`_ on a 3.4GHz Core
  i5 (Ivy Bridge).
* All command-line options can be set in a config file (``hmod.cfg``) so just ``hmod`` is
  enough to generate documentation
* Generates one file per module/``class``/``struct``/``enum``/etc. by default, as opposed
  to one file per module (old Phobos documentation) or one file per symbol (``ddox``).
* File paths can be made compatible with `ddox <https://github.com/rejectedsoftware/ddox>`_
  using the non-default ``--format=html-simple`` option
* Generated HTML enriched by classes to be more tweakable with CSS
* Custimizable main page, table of contents and style (CSS)
* Can exclude modules/packages from documentation by their name (not file name)
* Generated docs are usable without JavaScript (e.g. NoScript), JS may used for
  optional functionality
* **Only** generates HTML, and is unlikely to support any other formats


.. _differences:

----------------------------------
Differences from vanilla Markdown:
----------------------------------

* ``---`` will not generate a horizontal line, as it is used for DDoc blocks.

  Use ``- - -`` instead. This is still standard Markdown.

* *emphasis* can be denoted by ``*``, but not by ``_`` (this would break snake_case
  names).

* This does not work (again because DDoc uses ``---`` to mark code blocks)::

     Subheading
     ----------

  Instead, use either (standard Markdown)::

     ## Subheading

  Or (non-standard)::

     Subheading
     **********
